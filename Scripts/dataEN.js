        paragraph2: "So, why make this website? Well, because during the My Compass training, we used a whole new array of tools and programs practically each and every new day. In the end, I counted over 30 programs and websites that we used during the course. With so many tools and utilities, it becomes hard to keep them all in mind and a good overview over all of them. So, with the suggestion of my fellow former My Compass alumni, this website is meant to give everybody a good overview over all the tools that are used throughout the course, and for the other trainings, give a glimpse into all the tools that are used these days by web developers, be they specialized in the Front-end, Back-end, SEO or UX/UI. This is why I'm making this website",

        paragraph1: "Here I am cheating a bit: We never used a password manager. But since so many programs and websites have been used and all of them require a login, it's vital to have one to avoid having to reuse the same passwords over and over again on all the sites, and having them ready without needing to remember them. Considering that safety should be one of your highest priorities, you should not leave out this step. In fact, I consider this so vital I put it in front of everything, even the text editor in which you would write code! That's how important safe passwords are.",
