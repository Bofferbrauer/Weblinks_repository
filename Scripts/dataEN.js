        paragraph2: "So, why make this website? Well, because during the My Compass training, we used a whole new array of tools and programs practically each and every new day. In the end, I counted over 30 programs and websites that we used during the course. With so many tools and utilities, it becomes hard to keep them all in mind and a good overview over all of them. So, with the suggestion of my fellow former My Compass alumni, this website is meant to give everybody a good overview over all the tools that are used throughout the course, and for the other trainings, give a glimpse into all the tools that are used these days by web developers, be they specialized in the Front-end, Back-end, SEO or UX/UI. This is why I'm making this website",

        paragraph2: "Keep in mind we only ever used free or time-limited versions of the programs. So if you never used any of them before, they should all be available for free, even though for some of them just for a free introductionary week or month.",
