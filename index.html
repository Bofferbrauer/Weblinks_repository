                        personally.
                        It's free, it's open-source, and pretty powerful. It also comes with an extension for Chrome and
                        Opera
                        and
                        possibly other browsers too, so retrieving your password is very easy. Just make sure it saved
                        the
                        right
                        username and password, as it sometimes trips over itself here.</p>

                <p>To write code, you need a text editor. Any editor would do, but it's much easier with a powerful one.

                    Code
                    is
                    considered the best one right now, and that's what we're using.</p>

                <h3 id="JumpToPlan">Basic Planning</h3>
                <p>If you want to create a professional website, you need to plan and prepare everything about it first.
                    So
                    here
                    are
                    the tools you need to prepare your Websites before you can actually start to make the site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.gloomaps.com">Gloomaps</a></li>
                    <p>Gloomaps is a tool which helps you plan how the different pages of your website will be linked
                        together
                        by allowing you to create a visual sitemap of your site and pages.</p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://app.diagrams.net">Draw.io</a>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Draw.io allows you create a map of dependencies between the elements you have on your page,
                        specifically the scripts from JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        <span>Careful!</span>
                        <br>
                        There is another website with the name draw.io that looks
                        identical, but
                        costs for being used, and it ain't exactly cheap. So make sure you use the site in the link and
                        not the expensive knock-off.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://trello.com">Trello</a></li>
                    <p>Trello is a great tool to create a detailed to-do list, having an
                        overview of every step in the process. Especially useful in teams, but also for solo developers.
                    </p>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3 id="JumpToColors">Colors</h3>
                <p>A site needs colors, or it would be very boring. But you can't just take any color you want, they
                    need to
                    fit well together. To realize this, we need some tools that allow us to mix-and-match our colors
                    perfectly together.</p>
                <p>If you are working for a client, chances are that they have their set of colors that you are allowed
                    to
                    use, so in those cases there is no need to use a tool like these ones since the colors are preset
                    already.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a></li>
                    <p>A page's colors should complement each other and fit well together. With coolors you can generate
                        a palette of colors to use for your website. You can reload the colors until you find a set that
                        fits your needs and wishes for your website.</p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe Colors</a></li>
                    <p>Similar to coolors in that you can find and create a palette of colors that suits your website.
                        But here you have more direct control over which colors you can use and can see all the
                        dependencies between the colors better. It is however more complicated to use, so for beginners
                        coolors is generally recommended.</p>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3 id="JumpToLayout">Layout</h3>
                <p>Before the Website can be made, one needs to know what the website is supposed to look like in the
                    end.
                    Nowadays, there are normally at least 2 layouts that need to made, one mobile and one for desktop.
                    Adding a seperate layout for tablets is also a possibility that's often done. So the different
                    layouts
                    of the pages need to be set first before the page can actually get designed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://wireframe.cc">wireframe.cc</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Wireframe.cc is a website that allows you to make a basic sketch of your website within just a
                        couple of seconds. It's not very precise, but it allows to make a sketch of the design while
                        listening to the demands and wishes of the client.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Balsamiq allows you to create a precise sketch on how the website is supposed to look like in
                        the
                        end. With it, you can make pretty precise layouts without having to care about text or colors.
                        <br>
                        Sadly, it's license is only 30 days free, after which you have to pay at least either $9 a month
                        or
                        $90 a year. But for a professional this can be a very useful tool and thus quickly pay for
                        itself.

                <h3 id="JumpToFIS">Fonts, icons and symbols</h3>
                <p>Each website needs a distinct font or set of fonts to differentiate itself from the competition. And
                    pretty much every website also needs at least some icons or symbols to make the site look nice and
                    easily readable. So here you can find some sources for these elements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Google Fonts is a free service provided by Google to obtain a font from a large list of
                        possibilities. These fonts can either be downloaded or simply linked to their respective url.
                        The list of fonts is very large and you should find there whatever you need. As is the case with
                        the colors, a client can also tell you which font they want to use and provide it themselves too
                        if it's not a standard font but a propietary one.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Font Awesome can give you thousands of icons in a .svg format. What's special about them is
                        that, like the name of the website alludes, those icons are actually considered as fonts, not
                        svg pictures. As such, they need to be treated like text instead of images.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.flaticon.com">flaticon</a></li>
                    <p>
                        flaticon is a website where you can find any icon you might need. While some need a premium
                        account, the majority does notand there are so many you can be pretty sure you'll find what
                        you're looking for. That goes double with the fact that most icons have several variations that
                        can be downloaded either as an svg or png. In fact, you can actually download entire collections
                        of a theme to ensure that all your icons have the same style and there's no odd one out.

                <h3 id="JumpToPictures">Stock Pictures and Picture editing</h3>
                <p>Unless you have the right pictures already provided by your client for your website, you will either
                    need to hire a photographer or rely on stock photography and stock pictures to fill your pages.
                    There are plenty of websites that offer stock pictures, so if you can't find what you're looking for
                    on one site, try again on another one. Be aware that you will have to mention their creators in your
                    website credits if you use stock images.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://picsum.photos">Lorem Picsum</a></li>
                    <p>
                        If you don't have a final picture but need to get a placeholder, you can get stock pictures
                        specifically for this very need at Lorem Picsum. You don't need to credit anybody for these
                        pictures
                        as most of the time, they will not be part of the final design anyway.

                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Pexels doesn't just offer stock images, but also stock videos if you need more animated
                        content. All the pictures and videos are free and you even technically don't need to credit
                        the creators, but it's always better to do so. They have a large library of pictures, so
                        chances are that you can find what you're looking for.

                        and usage, like background for instance. Like with Pexels, crediting is not absolutely
                        necessary but since it falls under best practices, better credit them anyway. You wouldn't
                        want to be left out from mentioning the work you did either, would you?

                        Similar to Pexels, it comes with a very large collection of pictures. It has a very well sorted
                        catalogue and you can quickly find a picture that suits your needs here. Unsplash aslo comes
                        with a
                        dedicated wallpaper section for backgrounds of any kind, be that for desktop computers,
                        smartphones,
                        tablets, cellphones or even apps.

                        One problem that most designs have if they don't have a rectangular shape is that they tend to
                        have a solid background that in most cases needs to be removed. The same can of course happen
                        with pictures which may have an undesirable background or something that might not be legal or
                        free to show on your website. remove.bg can solve this problem easily for you, just drag and
                        drop or ctrl-v your picture into the tool and it will automatically remove it's background.

                        Pixlr is a free yet powerful online tool to edit your photos and to resize and reformat them. It
                        comes in two flavors; pixlr X for basic photo editing functions, and pixlr E for more advanced
                        photo editing functions. Some functions are hidden behind a paywall, but for more basic
                        functions it's more than powerful and versatile enough. It also comes with a function to remove
                        the background of your pictures in on click. And if all that wasn't enough yet, it also comes
                        with a library of over 50,000 stock pictures, many of which are free to use. So all in all a
                        very versatile tool that can be used for multiple functions at once.

                    <p>
                        Photos and pictures formatted in PNG tend to be very large and thus can be a hindrance for
                        websites, as they would take very long to load and quickly deplete the data plans for people
                        with have a limit there. tinyPNG compresses the files by reducing the color depth by removing
                        unused colors and removes all the unnecessary metadata. This results in pictures that are much
                        smaller in weight, often down to a quarter without affecting the format or transparency.

                        Adobe Photoshop is a very powerful and thus widely used tool to edit photos, to the extent that
                        photo editing is now colloquially known as "photoshopping". It's so well known that it doesn't
                        really need any further description here.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nowadays Photoshop is part of an entire family of photo editing programs from Adobe, which also
                        include Photoshop Lightroom, Photoshop Express and Photoshop Camera. Like all other Adobe
                        products, it is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, where you can use all Adobe products at once
                        for a monthly fee. Many companies use the Creative Cloud, so chances are relatively high to use
                        them on your future job, too.

                    So, now you have a basic layout, a color palette for your site, the right fonts and icons and some
                    pictures to show on your website. Only now it's actually time to make a definitive design on how
                    your website should look like. This has to include both desktop and mobile these days, specific
                    tablet designs are also increasingly used, but you can in theory make as many design variants
                    depending on the size of the screen as you want. With so many possible different variations, one
                    needs powerful tools to handle all the different design versions at once.

                        Adobe has a lot of products that are very helpful for any kind of design. To create Websites,
                        Adobe XD is their most powerful and versatile tool. Not only can you create website designs for
                        different screen sizes and breakpoints, you can also link the buttons you create there with
                        other pages to simulate a browsing experience on the website. You can also create design
                        elements like logos in Adobe XD to be used in the final website, but there are better tools
                        within the Adobe suit to fulfill that role.

                    <p>
                        Figma is a web-based design tool that allows for entire teams to collaborate on the creation of
                        a single design. It's not as resonsive as Adobe XD, but it's broader vision extends past
                        webdesign and it's ability to create a design live with other people certainly more than makes
                        up for that. This also means that you can not only create entire webpages, but of course also
                        every visual element of the pages within Figma and use them later in your website.

                    <p>
                        While Canva definitely has better uses in webdesign than to prototype a website, you can create
                        mobile and desktop website prototypes in Canva. But where Canva really shines in when it comes
                        to create every single other design element, like logos, banners, emails and social media posts.
                        The site comes with templates for each and every of these possibilities, complete with the exact
                        measurements for the chosen website when it comes to social media inclusion. It's very easy to
                        use, versatile and very powerful when you need design elements for and around your website.
