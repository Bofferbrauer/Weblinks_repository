            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello everybody to the Weblink repository of the My Compass, CodeStart and CodingJobs formations by
                NumericAll.
                This is a collection of all the links to the different tools that are being used during the trainings,
                of
                which
                there are A LOT</p>
            <p>So, why make this website? Well, because during the My Compass training, we used a whole new array of
                tools
                and
                programs practically each and every new day. In the end, I counted over 30 programs and websites that we
                used
                during the course. With so many tools and utilities, it becomes hard to keep them all in mind and a good
                overview over all of them. So, with the suggestion of my fellow former My Compass alumni, this website
                is
                meant
                to give everybody a good overview over all the tools that are used throughout the course, and for the
                other
                trainings, give a glimpse into all the tools that are used these days by web developers, be they
                specialized
                in
                the Front-end, Back-end, SEO or UX/UI. This is why I'm making this website </p>

            <h2>The List of tools</h2>
            <p>All the tools that we used will be listed here, sorted by category. Some may be downloadable, which will
                be
                mentioned if this is the case, but most of them are used online.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind we only ever used free or time-limited versions of the programs. So if you never used any of
                them
                before, they should all be available for free, even though for some of them just for a free
                introductionary
                week
                or month.</p>
            <p>So, without further ado, let's get started!</p>
        </article>
        <article>
            <section>
                <h3>Password Manager</h3>
                <p>Here I am cheating a bit: We never used a password manager. But since so many programs and websites
                    have
                    been
                    used and all of them require a login, it's vital to have one to avoid having to reuse the same
                    passwords
                    over
                    and over again on all the sites, and having them ready without needing to remember them. Considering
                    that
                    safety
                    should be one of your highest priorities, you should not leave out this step. In fact, I consider
                    this
                    so
                    vital
                    I put it in front of everything, even the text editor in which you would write code! That's how
                    important
                    safe
                    passwords are.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://bitwarden.com">Bitwarden</a></li>
                    <p>Since we didn't use a password manager during the course, I'm linking you to Bitwarden, which I
                        use
                        personally.
                        It's free, it's open-source, and pretty powerful. It also comes with an extension for Chrome and
                        Opera
                        and
                        possibly other browsers too, so retrieving your password is very easy. Just make sure it saved
                        the
                        right
                        username and password, as it sometimes trips over itself here.</p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Text Editor</h3>
                <p>To write code, you need a text editor. Any editor would do, but it's much easier with a powerful one.
                    VS
                    Code
                    is
                    condisered the best one right now, and that's what we're using.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS Code</a></li>
                    <p>VS Code comes with many extensions to make it prettier and more powerful. Some of the best
                        extensions
                        are
                        <a
                            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode">Prettier</a>

                            browser</a> to open the page in either your main or any other browser,

                        and
                        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments">Better

                        the
                        code.
                        Additionally, I use the <a
                            href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tinkertrain.theme-panda">Panda
                            Theme</a>
                        to
                        have
                        every element marked with different colors on a dark background, but if that's not your thing,
                        there
                        are
                        tons of
                        other themes that could better fit your interests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you are styling your pages with SASS or SCSS, I can also recommend you the following
                        extensions:
                        <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=P-de-Jong.vscode-html-scss">HTML
                            SCSS
                            support</a> to use SCSS, and both <a

                <h3>Basic Planning</h3>
                <p>If you want to create a professional website, you need to plan and prepare everything about it first.
                    So
                    here
                    are
                    the tools you need to prepare your Websites before you can actually start to make the site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.gloomaps.com">Gloomaps</a></li>
                    <p>Gloomaps is a tool which helps you plan how the different pages of your website will be linked
                        together
                        by allowing you to create a visual sitemap of your site and pages.</p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://app.diagrams.net">Draw.io</a>
                    </li>
                    <p>
                        Draw.io allows you create a map of dependencies between the elements you have on your page,
                        specifically the scripts from JavaScript.
                        <br>
                        <span>Careful!</span>
                        <br>
                        There is another website with the name draw.io that looks
                        identical, but
                        costs for being used, and it ain't exactly cheap. So make sure you use the site in the link and
                        not the expensive knock-off.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://trello.com">Trello</a></li>
                    <p>Trello is a great tool to create a detailed to-do list, having an
                        overview of every step in the process. Especially useful in teams, but also for solo developers.
                    </p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Colors</h3>
                <p>A site needs colors, or it would be very boring. But you can't just take any color you want, they
                    need to
                    fit well together. To realise this, we need some tools that allow us to mix-and-match our colors
                    perfectly together.</p>
                <p>If you are working for a client, chances are that they have their set of colors that you are allowed
                    to
                    use, so in those cases there is no need to use a tool like these ones since the colors are preset
                    already.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://coolors.co">Coolors</a></li>
                    <p>A page's colors should complement each other and fit well together. With coolors you can generate
                        a palette of colors to use for your website. You can reload the colors until you find a set that
                        fits your needs and wishes for your website.</p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe Colors</a></li>
                    <p>Similar to coolors in that you can find and create a palette of colors that suits your website.
                        But here you have more direct control over which colors you can use and can see all the
                        dependencies between the colors better. It is however more complicated to use, so for beginners
                        coolors is generally recommended.</p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Layout</h3>
                <p>Before the Website can be made, one needs to know what the website is supposed to look like in the
                    end.
                    Nowadays, there are normally at least 2 layouts that need to made, one mobile and one for desktop.
                    Adding a seperate layout for tablets is also a possibility that's often done. So the different
                    layouts
                    of the pages need to be set first before the page can actually get designed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://wireframe.cc">wireframe.cc</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Wireframe.cc is a website that allows you to make a basic sketch of your website within just a
                        couple of seconds. It's not very precise, but it allows to make a sketch of the design while
                        listening to the demands and wishes of the client.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Balsamiq allows you to create a precise sketch on how the website is supposed to look like in
                        the
                        end. With it, youcan make pretty precise layouts without having to care about text or colors.
                        <br>
                        Sadly, it's license is only 30 days free, after which you have to pay at least either $9 a month
                        or
                        $90 a year. But for a professional this can be a very useful tool and thus quickly pay for
                        itself.
                    </p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>Fonts, icons and symbols</h3>
                <p>Each website needs a distinct font or set of fonts to differentiate itself from the competition. And
                    pretty much every website also needs at least some icons or symbols to make the site look nice and
                    easily readable. So here you can find some sources for these elements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://fonts.google.com">Google Fonts</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Google Fonts is a free service provided by Google to optain a font from a large list of
                        possibilities. These fonts can either be downloaded or simply linked to their respective url.
                        The list of fonts is very large and you should find there whatever you need. As is the case with
                        the colors, a client can also tell you which font they want to use and provide it themselves too
                        if it's not a standard font but a propietary one.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://fontawesome.com">Font Awesome</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Font Awesome can give you thousands of icons in a .svg format. What's special about them is
                        that, like the name of the website alludes, those icons are actually considered as fonts, not
                        svg pictures. As such, they need to be treated like text instead of images.
                    </p>
                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.flaticon.com">flaticon</a></li>
                    <p>
                        flaticon is a website where you can find any icon you might need. While some need a premium
                        account, the majority does notand there are so many you can be pretty sure you'll find what
                        you're looking for. That goes double with the fact that most icons have several variations that
                        can be downloaded either as an svg or png. In fact, you can actually download entire collections
                        of a theme to ensure that all your icons have the same style and there's no odd one out.
                    </p>

                <h3>Stock Pictures</h3>
                <p>Unless you have the right pictures already provided by your client for your website, you will either
                    need to hire a photographer or rely on stock photography and stock pictures to fill your pages.
                    There are plenty of websites that offer stock pictures, so if you can't find what you're looking for
                    on one site, try again on another one. Be aware that you will have to mention their creators in your
                    website credits if you use stock images.</p>

                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://picsum.photos">Lorem Picsum</a></li>
                    <p>
                        If you don't have a final picture but need to get a placeholder, you can get stock pictures
                        specifically for this very need at Lorem Picsum. You don't need to credit anybody for these
                        pictures
                        as most of the time, they will not be part of the final design anyway.

                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Pexels doesn't just offer stock images, but also stock videos if you need more animated
                        content. All the pictures and videos are free and you even technically don't need to credit
                        the creators, but it's always better to do so. They have a large library of pictures, so
                        chances are that you can find what you're looking for.

                    <p>
                        Stocksnap.io offers a broad selection of free stock pictures, which can be sorted by themes
                        and usage, like background for instance. Like with Pexels, crediting is not absolutely
                        neccessary but since it falls under best practices, better credit them anyway. You wouldn't
                        want to be left out from mentioning the work you did either, would you?

                    <p>
                        Similar to Pexels, it comes with a very large collection of pictures. It has a very well sorted
                        catalogue and you can quickly find a picture that suits your needs here. Unsplash aslo comes
                        with a
                        dedicated wallpaper section for backgrounds of any kind, be that for desktop computers,
                        smartphones,
                        tablets, cellphones or even apps.

                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>
                    So, now you have a basic layout, a color palette for your site, the right fonts and icons and some
                    pictures to show on your website. Only now it's actually time to make a definitive design on how
                    your website should look like. This has to include both desktop and mobile these days, specific
                    tablet designs are also increasingly used, but you can in theory make as many design variants
                    depending on the size of the screen as you want. With so many possible different variations, one
                    needs powerful tools to handle all the different design versions at once.

                    <li><a class="sitelist" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a></li>
                    <p>
                        Adobe has a lot of products that are very helpful for any kind of design. To create Websites,
                        Adobe XD is their most powerful and versatile tool. Not only can you create website designs for
                        different screen sizes and breakpoints, you can also link the buttons you create there with
                        other pages to simulate a browsing experience on the website.

                    <p>
                        Figma is a web-based design tool that allows for entire teams to collaborate on the creation of
                        a single design. It's not as resonsive as Adobe XD, but it's broader vision extends past
                        webdesign and it's ability to create a design live with other people certainly more than makes
                        up for that.
